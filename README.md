## About DeepSeek

DeepSeek is the name of a free AI-powered chatbot, which looks, feels and works very much like ChatGPT.
That means it's used for many of the same tasks, though exactly how well it works compared to its rivals is up for debate.
It is reportedly as powerful as OpenAI's o1 model - released at the end of last year - in tasks including mathematics and coding.
Like o1, R1 is a "reasoning" model. These models produce responses incrementally, simulating how humans reason through problems or ideas.
